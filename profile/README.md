The Northwest River Forecast Center (NWRFC) is one of thirteen River Forecast Centers that are part of the United States (US) National Weather Service (NWS), which is in turn part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The NWRFC's operational mission includes (1) modeling river basins across the Pacific Northwest in the Columbia River and Coastal Basins in Washington and Oregon (2) providing water resource forecasts and guidance for region, and (3) supporting decision-making while collaborating with NWS core partners. The Pacific Northwest region is composed of a wide range of hydrologic conditions including rain dominated, snow dominated, glaciated, tidally influenced and arid basins, some of which exist in Canada and eventually flow into the US. Forecasts developed by the NWRFC are used across the region to provide timely information about flooding, water supply, drought, recreation, navigation, and environmental flows.

**Mission:** To save lives and decrease property damage by the issuance of flood warnings and river stage forecasts. Provide basic hydrologic forecast information for the Nation's economic and environmental well being. Provide extended forecast information for water resources management.

**Service Area:** The area of responsibility encompasses over 285,786 square miles and includes parts of 7 states and parts of western Canada. It is the second most hydrologic active River Forecast Center in the United States
